## Features

* [Progressive Web App](https://madhatted.com/2017/6/16/building-a-progressive-web-app-with-ember)
  * Perfect ðŸ’¯ Lighthouse score
  * Save to mobile home screen for fullscreen app experience
  * Offline cache fallback via service worker

* [Module Unification](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md) File Layout
  * File system migrated with [ember-module-migrator](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-module-migrator)
  * Review the project's file structure organized within `src` directory rather than `app`
  * Uses local component lookup (components found in context-aware `-component` directories)

* [Fastboot Rehydration](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/commit/316805b9175e01698120b9566ec51c88d075026a)

  What is Rehydration?

  The rehydration feature means that the Glimmer VM can take a DOM tree created
  using Server Side Rendering (SSR) and use it as the starting point for the
  append pass. This reuses the rendering work already done on the server, allowing
  Ember applications to start with the existing DOM rather than throwing it away and generating it all over again client-side.

* [ES5 Getters](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0281-es5-getters.md)

  In this application we are running a Canary build of Ember which will
  eventually become 3.2.  In 3.2 of Ember.js es5 getters are automatically
  installed for computed properties onto the Object prototype.  So you can use
  `this.myComputedProperty` without reaching for the `get` helper

* No jQuery!
